# MicroService-Design-Patterns

I use this for documenting my understandings collected from various sources for future purpose. 

## Advantages of microservices
- Easier to develop, understand, maintain
- Starts faster than a monolith, speeds up deployments
- Local change can be easily deployed, great enabler of CD
- Each service can scale on X- and Z-axis
- Improves fault isolation 

## Design Principles for Monoliths
- DDD (Domain Driven Design)
- SoC using MVC (Separation Of Concerns)
- High cohesion, low coupling
- DRY(Dont repeat yourself)
- CoC (Code Of Conduct)
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
